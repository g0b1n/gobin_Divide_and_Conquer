In this exercise, you’ll utilize problem solving patterns to solve the following code challenges:

## **countZeroes**

Given an array of 1s and 0s which has all 1s first followed by all 0s, write a function called ***countZeroes***, which returns the number of zeroes in the array.

**Constraints**:

Time Complexity: O(log N)


## **sortedFrequency**

Given a sorted array and a number, write a function called ***sortedFrequency*** that counts the occurrences of the number in the array

**Constraints**:

Time Complexity: O(log N)


## **findRotatedIndex**

Write a function called ***findRotatedIndex*** which accepts a rotated array of sorted numbers and an integer. The function should return the index of num in the array. If the value is not found, return -1.

**Constraints**:

Time Complexity: O(log N)


## **findRotationCount**

Write a function called ***findRotationCount*** which accepts an array of distinct numbers sorted in increasing order. The array has been rotated counter-clockwise n number of times. Given such an array, find the value of n.

**Constraints**:

Time Complexity: O(log N)


## **findFloor**

Write a function called ***findFloor*** which accepts a sorted array and a value x, and returns the floor of x in the array. The floor of x in an array is the largest element in the array which is smaller than or equal to x. If the floor does not exist, return -1.

**Constraints**

Time Complexity: O(log N)
